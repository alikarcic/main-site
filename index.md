I am a Political Science PhD student at the Department of Political Science, Aarhus University. 

My research focuses on political elites and inter-group attitudes, with a particular focus on elite rhetoric, mainstream party accommodation of the far-right and anti-prejudice norms. I make use of quantitative and experimental methods.
