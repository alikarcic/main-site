I am a Political Science PhD student at the Department of Political Science, Aarhus University. 

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political behavior, and focuses on the broad question of how political elites can influence citizens. I study this question in the context of liberal democracies by focusing on the rhetorical dimension of politics: In particular, I am interested in how political parties use rhetoric to respond to electoral competition from challenger parties, how hostile rhetoric towards out-partisans and immigrants affects the attitudes, and under what conditions such rhetoric erodes democratic norms. 

To investigate these questions, my research relies on a wide array of quantitative methods with an emphasis on causal inference. I make use of both comparative research designs, computational text analysis approaches, survey experiments, and behavioral experiments.
